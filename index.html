    <h1>Coffee</h1>
    <p>Coffee has played a vital role in my life. My coffee addiction got so bad that I had to work for <strong> Starbucks</strong>.
    I love making, drinking, and talking about coffee. 
    My favorite drink to make is an iced caramel macchiato.
    A <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/menu/product/413/hot" title="Starbucks recipie">caramel macchiato</a> is fun to make because 
    the shots sits on top of the coffee, so it is visually pleasing.</p>
